# neural-network-bike-prediction

This is the 1st project of Udacity - Nanodegree Deep Learning Fundamentals.

### Introduction

In this project, you will make a neural network to solve a prediction problem in a real dataset! By building a neural network from scratch, you will understand much better how downlink gradients, backpropagations, and other important concepts work before we start using tools like Tensorflow. You also get a chance to see your network solving a real problem!

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.
